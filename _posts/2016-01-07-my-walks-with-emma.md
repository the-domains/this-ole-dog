We always took our stroll the moment I got home. Most days Emma was waiting outside the front door and would follow me inside to the kitchen. That's where I'd grab a handful of biscuits from a cut-glass jar. To Emma's ears, the sound of the frosted glass stopper being lifted, biscuits stirring and the stopper sliding back in place, meant that it was time to go. And Emma was always ready.

When cars approached as we walked along the rural street, we'd step aside, stop, and let them pass. And each time a car passed Emma took her seat and waited to be served. No pleading. No pawing. No snatching the biscuit from my hand. When offered, she politely accepted. It was a rite that we performed daily for nearly 12 years. 

It's easy to exagertate our relationship beyond the bond that most humans feel for a dog. There are thousands of examples of mutual devotion and extreme sacrifice that exceed my experience with Emma. But I was lucky to have such a patient and dedicated mentor and I'm grateful.
