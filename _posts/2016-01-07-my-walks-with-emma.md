We always took our stroll the moment I got home. Most days Emma was waiting outside the front door and would follow me inside to the kitchen. That's where I'd grab a handful of biscuits from a cut-glass jar. To Emma's ears, the sound of the frosted glass stopper being lifted, biscuits stirring and the stopper sliding back in place, meant that it was time to go. And Emma was always ready.

When cars approached as we walked along the rural street, we'd step aside, stop, and let them pass. And each time a car passed Emma took her seat and waited to be served. No pleading. No pawing. No snatching the biscuit from my hand. When offered, she politely accepted. It was a rite that we performed daily for nearly 12 years. 

Emma and I shared a bond that is familiar to many people. I'm tempted to say that my feelings exceeded what most humans feel for a dog. But I know that there are levels of mutual devotion and extreme sacrifice that we didn't test. I'm just grateful for her patient and non-negotiable requirement that I display my 'best side' when we walked.  As a result, she was a perfect mentor, leading without directing, facilitating introspection with strategic silence and acceding to the long way around for the sake of the lesson learned.

I have been a student, a member of athletic teams and "the new guy" in various business endeavors. In each case, I had help learning the ropes. But I would have appreciated a mentor if I'd known one or how to find one. I regret to say that Emma is the only mentor I ever had. So it seems fair that now it's my turn to extend a hand.

This is the first of an unknown number of periodic observations about mentoring and those who mentor. I won't perform or review any formal academic research on the subject. Let's just think of this as a meandering stroll with a one-sided conversation. You'll have to bring your own biscuits.
