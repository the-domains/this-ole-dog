I'm tempted to say that my feelings for Emma are beyond comprehension, but I realize that close bonds between dogs and humans are common. I'll just say that when we were together, Emma and I made a perfect pair, because our 'best selves' were also present.

Emma was the perfect mentor. She knew how to lead me without being obvious. She accomdated my introspection with supportive silence. And she never argued about taking the long-way-round when I got lost. 

You hear the terms, mentor and mentoring, more frequently today than you used to. In all my years as a banker and an entrepreneur, I never had a mentor and none of my peers had one either. The "good ole boys" network existed, but that was different. Now it seems that mentors are everywhere. Especially if you are starting a tech business.  Today, mentors even come packaged with seed funding provided by startup accelerators

Taking up where Emma left off, this ole dog is on the mentors' trail.  Expect a meandering monologue about mentoring and those generous folks who make it available.

Leashes optional.
