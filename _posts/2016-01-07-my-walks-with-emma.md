We always took our stroll the moment I got home. Most days Emma was waiting outside the front door and would follow me inside to the kitchen. That's where I'd grab a handful of biscuits from a cut-glass jar. To Emma's ears, the sound of the frosted glass stopper being lifted, biscuits stirring and the stopper sliding back in place, meant that it was time to go. And Emma was always ready.

When cars approached as we walked along the rural street, we'd step aside, stop, and let them pass. And each time a car passed Emma took her seat and waited to be served. No pleading. No pawing. No snatching the biscuit from my hand. When offered, she politely accepted. It was a rite that we performed daily for nearly 12 years. 

I'm tempted to exaggerate my relationship with Emma beyond the bond that most humans feel for a dog. But I know that there are thousands of examples of mutual devotion and extreme sacrifice that exceed my experience with Emma. Honestly, I'm very grateful to have had such a patient and dedicated companion and mentor. So much so, that I feel obligated to return the favor. 

While Emma was the only mentor I ever had, I have been a student, a member of athletic teams and "the new guy" in various businesses. In each instance I learned the ropes with some help, but I would have appreciated having a mentor if I'd known one was available or how to find one.

This is the first of an unknown number of periodic observations about the act of mentoring and those who mentor. I don't intend to formally research the subject. Just think of this as a stroll and a one-sided conversation. Bring your own biscuits.
