I'm tempted to say that my feelings for Emma are beyond comprehension. But the bond that can form between dogs and humans is well known and well documented. I'll just say that Emma and I were a perfect match because we shared our 'best selves' with each other whenever we were together.

I hear and read the words, mentor and mentoring, more frequently today than I used to. When I was an entrepreneur, and a banker before that, none of my peers had a mentor. Sure there was the "good ole boys network", but that was different. 

Emma was the perfect mentor. She could lead without directing. She honored introspection in silence. And she never objected to taking the long-way-round when the route was uncertain.

I think I'm ready to extend the mentor's hand. Think of this blog as a one-sided, meandering conversation about mentoring. 

Leashes optional.
