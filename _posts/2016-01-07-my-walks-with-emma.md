I'm tempted to say that my feelings for Emma are beyond explanation. But I'll just mention that our 'best selves' were always present during our daily walks.

Emma was a skilled mentor. She knew how to lead without being pushy. She encouraged introspection with thoughtful silence. And she never complained about having to take the long way when I got lost. 

You hear the terms, mentor and mentoring, more frequently today than you used to. In all my years as a banker and an entrepreneur, I never had a mentor. And none of my peers had one either. The "good ole boys" network existed, but that was different. Now it seems that mentors are everywhere. Today, mentors even come packaged with seed funding provided by some startup accelerators. 

This ole dog plans to take up where Emma left me on the mentors' trail. I hope you will join me as I explore the act of mentoring and meet some mentors and proteges along the way. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/428f8b49-cf93-48a8-b0ef-947ac4fb9a90.jpg)
