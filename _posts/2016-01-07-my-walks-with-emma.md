We always took our stroll the moment I got home. Most days Emma was waiting outside the front door and would follow me inside to the kitchen. That's where I'd grab a handful of dog biscuits from the cut-glass dog cookie jar. To Emma's ears, whenever it was lifted and slid it back into place, the jar's frosted glass stopper signaled that it was "time to go". Emma was ready.

If cars passed us as we walked along the rural street, we'd step aside, stop, and let them pass. And each time a car passed Emma took her seat and waited to be served. No pleading. No pawing. No snatching the biscuit from my hand. When offered, she politely accepted. It was our routine. One that lasted nearly 12 years. 

It's easy to magnify our relationship beyond the bond that practically every human feels for a dog. There are too many examples of mutual devotion and extreme sacrifice (in both directions) that exceed my experience with Emma. I was just lucky and I'm grateful.
