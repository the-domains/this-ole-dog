I'm tempted to say that my feelings for Emma are beyond comprehension, but I realize that close bonds between dogs and humans are common. I'll just say that when we were together Emma and I made the perfect team. Because that's when our 'best selves' were present.

Emma was a skilled mentor. She knew how to lead without being pushy. She accomdated introspection with supportive silence. And she never argued about taking the long-way-round when I was lost. 

You hear the terms, mentor and mentoring, more frequently today than you used to. In all my years as a banker and an entrepreneur, I never had a mentor and none of my peers had one either. The "good ole boys" network existed, but that was different. Now it seems that mentors are everywhere. Especially if you are starting a tech business.  Today, mentors even come packaged with seed funding provided by startup accelerators

Taking up where Emma left off, this ole dog is on the mentors' trail.  Expect a meandering monologue about the process of mentoring and about those generous folks who give it away with no strings attached.
